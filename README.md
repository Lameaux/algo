# Algorithms and Data Structures

This is my sandbox for playing with algorithms and data structures. There you can find **Java** implementation of:

### Sorting
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - MergeSort
  - QuickSort

### List
  - ArrayList impl.
  - LinkedList impl.

### Binary Search Tree (BST)
  - BST using backing **array**
  - BST using recursion

### Utilities
  - Reversion of LinkedList and array
  - Swapping using XOR
  - Object.equals
  - etc.

### Programming Puzzles
  - PermissionTree (TopCoder)
  - BloggDocStructure (TopCoder)


Code is covered with unit-tests. You can import the project in Eclipse and run tests with JUnit.

P.S. Feel free to use any of these codes.
